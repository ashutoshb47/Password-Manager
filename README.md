# Password-Manager
It is a simple password manager that stores new passwords and generates random and strong passwords according to the given length.

Working:
It is basically a CLI(command line interface) based python program. It first asks for the option you want to opt for then works accordingly. The details like sitename, username and passwords are stored in a table in a database. I have used mysql database for this password manager.
